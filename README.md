# http_server
## Introduction
A simple http server based on Node.js

Since this is just a simple version, everything, including packages in ./node_modules would be uploaded

## How to run the project
in the directory, make sure you have installed in your computer and port 8888 is available, then run

node index.js

and visit http://localhost:8888

Boom! (I know, it is not so exciting though...)
